## This project was created using **Dash** and **Atlas Mongo Database** to visualise in-depth statistics for the Premier League 2018-19 Season. 

1. ### Statistics like passes, goals, assists for every player in the PL can be found and visualised.

1. ### Different players can be compared based on a common metric.

1. ### Fixtures of every team can be viewed along with the score and statistics for a particular match.

___
### Note: You will **NOT** be able to replicate this project on your local device because it uses a remote personal Atlas Mongo Database.
